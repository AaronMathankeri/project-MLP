- need to figure out a python implementation and translate to C++.
- must be able to read in a dataset
- then analyse with simple neural network

- finished the python implementation
- write the dataset to a file

- assume data is in right format. how does that look in C++?
  - is it a matrix?, a vector? an array?

for now, hard code values from first 10 elements in python src!

alright, took care of all the I/O. Now time for the actual ML!

scaling everythin back. getting confused with the number of samples.
For now, 2d input array, 1d target vector. getting it working and
then worry about all the book keeping.

Need to add "weight matrix". Weight Matrix will be randomly initialized,
and values will be learned through backpropagation error.

For this toy example, there is only 1 output. This means that
the error function will be replaced by the cross entropy error
AND
"weight matrix" for the second layer is a vector!
